# Demos-With-GameMaker-Studio-2
 A collection of different types of demos made in GameMaker Studio 2. Some of these projects were completed within the ART 2020 course for Video Game Prototyping at Louisiana State University with Professor Aubanel.

 ## [Breakfast 'n' Bed](https://github.com/codingwithcolors/Demos-With-GameMaker-Studio-2/tree/main/Breakfast-n-Bed)
A point 'n' click adventure game demo centered around the theme "joy". Of course what's more joyful than family, fun, and sandwiches? This demo with multiple endings was inspired by the genre of 'choose your own adventure' books.

## [Colors-Quiz](https://github.com/codingwithcolors/Demos-With-GameMaker-Studio-2/tree/main/Colors-Quiz)
An educational game demo based on the theme "colors". This demo quizzes the player on a fun fact on each of the seven colors of the rainbow. The player must answer all seven questions correctly to return color back to the monochrome gray world.

## [Intro-Tile-and-Animation](https://github.com/codingwithcolors/Demos-With-GameMaker-Studio-2/tree/main/Intro-Tile-and-Animation)
My first introduction to GameMaker Studio 2 a few years ago, which involved learning how to make tilesets, animations, and collision. While it is not a game demo, it taught me the foundation for other projects.
