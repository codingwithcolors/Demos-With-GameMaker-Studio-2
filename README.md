 ## [Breakfast 'n' Bed](https://github.com/codingwithcolors/Demos-With-GameMaker-Studio-2/tree/main/Breakfast-n-Bed)
A point 'n' click adventure game demo centered around the theme 'joy'. Of course what's more joyful than family, fun, and sandwiches? This demo with multiple endings was inspired by various 'choose your own adventure' books I've read over the years.
