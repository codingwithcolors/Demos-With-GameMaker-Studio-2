# Colors-Quiz
This was a three week long project in my ART 2020 Video Game Prototyping course at Louisiana State University. The theme for this project was "choose your own theme", so I chose "colors" of course. As you can tell by my username, I love anything to do with color theory and/or the history of colors. Since this was a choose your own theme game, I got to experiment with a few different techniques and shaders. This game demo was really fun to work on, and I hope you learn some interesting color history facts while playing it!

## Introduction
The world has lost all of its color and is now gray. You find yourself in a series of mysterious rooms. Each one of these rooms contains a man, a key, and a television. In this game demo, you will be asked a series of questions about the history of seven different colors. Hope you studied, because one wrong answer will mean you have to start all over again. Can you bring color back to this world?
