# Breakfast 'n' Bed
This is a three week long project that initially started in my ART 2020 Video Game Prototyping course at Louisiana State University. The theme for this project was "joy". It was really fun to brainstorm short story and learn some new techniques in GameMaker. I hope you enjoy!

## Introduction
You play as a young girl named Susy. Susy's mom is sick with the flu and stuck in bed. What better way to cheer her up than with one of the best things in the world? A sandwich of course! The problem is, Susy is still learning how to cook and doesn't know which ingredients to choose for the sandwich. You, as the player, get to click and choose the  ingredients to help Susy out.

There are 8 unique endings. Some sandwiches even help Susy's mom feel better! ...while others...may make her more sick. Can you find them all and bring joy back to Susy's mom?"

## How To Play
